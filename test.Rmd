# Summary
## Context
The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is the standard measure of deprivation and poverty in England. It is widely used by government and researchers to allocate resources and inform recommendations on health and social policy. Since 2004 the IMD has been based on the weighted measurement of seven "domains" of deprivation, each of which is compromised of multiple indicators based on official government data for around 32,000 neighborhoods - Lower Level Super Output Areas (LSOA). The weight attributed to each domain has remained consistent over time. However, the composition and measurement of the underlying indicators of each domain has undergone multiple changes - often in successive versions of the IMD. On the one hand, this adaptive design philosophy makes the IMD highly robust to policy changes and shifts in research and data standards, ensuring that each version of the IMD captures the determinants of deprivation as defined by the contexts of that time. On the other hand, differences between each IMD preclude reliable statistical analysis of the effects of deprivation across time. Therefore, 
in a distinct lack of understanding of the effects of relative change in deprivation levels. Put another way, while the IMD is a rich source for analyzing the effects of *being* more or less deprived, its widespread usage has somewhat stymied our understanding of the effects of *becoming* more or less deprived, as well as of possible inter-dependencies between these effects. 

## Objectives
This research is guided by three main objectives:

1. To devise a method for creating a time-adjusted IMD, enabling analysis of the effects of deprivation across time
2. To apply of this method to the analysis of mortality rates, leveraging the explanatory potential of Random Effects Within Between panel models
# Enabling backwards compatibility

## Method

### Crtiteria
In the 2015 and 2019 technical reports, the architects of the IMD state that previous versions "should not be used as a time series" for the following reasons:

1. The addition of new indicators
2. Changes to the measurement of existing indicators
3. Changes to LSOA boundaries

I thus present a method to enable backwards compatibility via the removal/minimization of the impacts of the above.

### Regression scaling
The method I employ is adapted from the work of Abel and colleagues, who have constructed a UK-wide IMD which enables between-country comparisons despite  variation in the weighting and measurement of the domains which form each country's IMD. At its core, their method is designed to exploit the fact that the weighting and measurement of the income and employment domains is "approximately comparable across countries". They first fit a simple linear regression for each country, with IMD score as the outcome variable and income and employment domain scores as covariates. They then scale the income and employment scores - and the regression residuals, which "represent the unique contribution of the domains, other than income and employment, to the overall IMD" - of each country by the regression equation of a given reference country.

Taking Northern Ireland, $n$, as the reference, adjusted IMD for country $c$ can be expressed as:

$$IMD_{c-ADJUSTEDi} = \beta_{n0} + \beta_{n1}I_{ci} + \beta_{n2}E_{ci} + \frac{\epsilon_{ci} \sigma_{n}} {\sigma_{c}}  $$
where $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ are the regression coefficients, $I_{i}$ is income score, $E_{i}$ is employment score, $\epsilon_{i}$ is the residual value and $\sigma$ is the residual S.D.

The resulting country-adjusted IMD is thus predominately based on domains which are comparable between countries and which together account for approximately 95% of within-country variation in IMD score. The 5% of variation which is not explained by these domains is captured by the residuals from each country regression, which are standardized and scaled by the standard deviation of the residuals from the reference country regression. In this way, the contribution of the other five domains is reduced from 50% to roughly 5%. 

### Reducing the influence of time-variant domains
The potential transferability of this method to the issue of backwards compatibility is clear, given that variation in the measurement of domain scores is the primary barrier to the use of IMD in both time series and inter-country analysis. The particular exigencies of backwards compatibility are, however, different to that of between-country comparability. And so an adapted version of the above method is required. 

In the first instance, the domains which are comparable across countries vary considerably across time. Specifically, the measurement of nearly every indicator used for the income and employment domains was changed in the 2019 IMD to account for the transformation of the benefit system under UC. While these two domains alone have a combined weight of 50% within the overall IMD, it is significant that the weighting and measurement of the other five domains - the remaining 50% - is largely the same across the 2010, 2015 and 2019 indices.
``` {r, include = FALSE}
tab_cap(name = "tab1", caption = "By-year comparison of the weighting and underlying indicators of five domains of IMD")
```
`r tab_cap("tab1")`
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%',out.length = '50%',fig.align='center', fig.cap = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Matt/Documents/Papers/Time Adjusted IMD/Scripts/tab1.jpg")
```
In fact, even after accounting for a few minor differences (see Table 1 footnotes), the weighting and measurement of these five domains across time is more consistent than that of the income and employment domains across countries. *Prima facie*, time-adjusted IMD can thus be expressed as:

$$
IMD_{t-ADJUSTEDi} =
\beta_{y0} + \beta_{y1}E_{ti} + \beta_{y2}H_{ti} +\beta_{y3}C_{ti} + \beta_{y4}B_{ti} + \beta_{y5}L_{ti} + \frac{\epsilon_{ti} \sigma_{y}} {\sigma_{t}}
$$
where $y$ is the reference year, $E_{i}$ is education score, $H_{i}$ is health score, $C_{i}$ is crime score, $B_{i}$ is barriers score and $L_{i}$ is living environment score.

Yet domain measurement is not only the source of temporal variation. Changes to LSOA boundaries were made in 2011; this means the 2015 and 2019 indices are not geographically compatible with the 2010 IMD. In total, 1,398 of 34,917 pre-2011 England LSOAs were affected by these changes. 163 of these were subject to "complex correction", for which it is not possible to map to a 2011 equivalent. A further 922 were split into two separate LSOAs, while 313 were merged into a single LSOA. It is possible to map both split and merged LSOAs to 2011 equivalents. However, this results in a "hybrid" LSOA geography, which is not readily compatible with other UK area-based datasets. Therefore, with a view to creating a time-adjusted IMD with out-of-the-box functionality, I drop the 922 split LSOAs, and and their post-2011 equivalents. But keep the 313 merged LSOAs by aggregating 2010 IMD scores for affected pair-wise areas. Overall, 1085 LSOAs were omitted, which equates to 3.1% of England LSOAs.


## Implementation
### Data preparation and geographical aggregation
The 2010 IMD datset with domain scores:
```{r, include=TRUE}
head(IMD_2010.df, 10)
```
Trim LSOA strings and merge with LSOA boundary changes lookup table:
```{r, include=TRUE}
IMD_2010.df$LSOA_code_old <- stringr::str_trim(IMD_2010.df$LSOA_code_old)
LSOA_bound.df$LSOA_code_old <- stringr::str_trim(LSOA_bound.df$LSOA_code_old)
LSOA_bound.df$LSOA_code <- stringr::str_trim(LSOA_bound.df$LSOA_code)

IMD_2010_bound.df <- dplyr::left_join(IMD_2010.df, LSOA_bound.df,
                                      by = "LSOA_code_old")
```
Aggregate merged LSOAs:
```{r, include=TRUE}
attach(IMD_2010_bound.df)
IMD_2010_2011B.df <- IMD_2010_bound.df %>%
  dplyr::group_by(LSOA_code) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(across(c(IMD, health, educ, barr, crime, livenv), ~
                         case_when(change == "M" ~ mean(.),
                                   TRUE ~ .)))  %>%
  dplyr::distinct(LSOA_code, .keep_all = TRUE)  %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()
detach(IMD_2010_bound.df)
```
### OLS regression
I first fit OLS regressions models of IMD score on IMD domains by year.

2010:
```{r, results = "asis"}
lm.2010 <- lm(IMD ~ educ + health + crime + barr + livenv, data = IMD_2010_2011B.df)
paste("$R^{2}$ = ", round(summary(lm.2010)$r.squared,3))
```
<br />
<br />
2015:
```{r, results = "asis"}
lm.2015 <- lm(IMD ~ educ + health + crime + barr + livenv, data = IMD_2015.df)
paste("$R^{2}$ = ", round(summary(lm.2015)$r.squared,3))
```
<br />
<br />
2019:
```{r, results = "asis"}
lm.2019 <- lm(IMD ~ educ + health + crime + barr + livenv, data = IMD_2019.df)
paste("$R^{2}$ = ",round(summary(lm.2019)$r.squared,3))
```
<br />
<br />
Two things to note here:

1. 2015 has the highest $R^{2}$, and so will be used as the reference (scaling) year.
2. $R^{2}$ values fall short of the 95% benchmark set by Abel and colleagues. 

### Inspecting residuals
None of the models above are able to explain more than 92.28% of variance in IMD. This amount of unexplained variance is potentially problematic. Recall that the percentage of variation which is not explained by the model is represented by the residual, which is equivalent to the influence of the time-varying income and employment domains. I thus plot residuals by domain score so as to assess model fit and whether variable transformation is required.
```{r, include= FALSE}
# Residuals to data frame
IMD_2015.df$residual <- residuals(lm.2015)
# Domains input vector
doms = names(IMD_2015.df)[4:8]
doms = set_names(doms)
domnames.vec <-c("Education", "Health", "Crime", "Barriers", "Living environment")
P1_line_1 <- expression(paste(italic("Note"),". Plot of residuals by domain from OLS regression of 2015 IMD score on 2015 IMD domain scores. Solid yellow lines represent locally smoothed fit from")) 
P1_line_2 <- ("LOESS regression using a bandwidth of 0.25.")
```
Residual plot function with LOESS smoother:
```{r, include = TRUE}
# Define function
residplot.fun = function(xF, yF) {
  
  # Get loess smmothed predictions
  f <- paste("residual ~", xF)              
  domcount <<- domcount + 1                 
  loess <- loess(f, data = IMD_2015.df, span = 0.25)
  loess_fit <- as.data.frame(predict(loess))
  names(loess_fit) <- c("fit")                        
  IMD_2015.df$fit <- loess_fit$fit          
  IMD_2015.df <- IMD_2015.df %>%            
    dplyr::arrange(xF)
  
  # Residual plot
  resdom.gg <- 
    ggplot(IMD_2015.df, 
               aes(x = .data[[xF]], y = .data[[yF]]) ) +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0, size= 0.25, 
               color="black", linetype = "dashed") +
    geom_point(shape = 1, size = .2, color = "#868686",
               alpha = .4, position = position_jitter(w = 0.2)) +
    geom_line(IMD_2015.df, mapping = 
              aes(x = .data[[xF]], y = fit), col = "#EFC000",size= 1) +
    labs(x = domnames.vec[domcount], y = "Residual") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(
      plot.margin = unit(c(.1, .1, .1, .1), "cm"))
  
  # Axis options depending on plot position
  if (xF == "educ" || xF == "barr") {
    resdom.gg <- resdom.gg + theme(axis.title.y=element_text(vjust = -0.05))
    return(resdom.gg)
  } 
  
  else {
    resdom.gg <- resdom.gg + theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(),
                     axis.text.y = element_blank(),
                     axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
    return(resdom.gg)
  }
  
}

# Apply function to each IMD domain
domcount <- 0   
domresplots <- lapply(doms, FUN = residplot.fun, y= "residual")
```
Final combined plot:
```{r, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.cap = "Residual plot by domain score"}
# Combine residual plots
resdomC.gg <- cowplot::plot_grid(domresplots[[1]], domresplots[[2]],
                                 domresplots[[3]], domresplots[[4]],
                                 domresplots[[5]],nrow=2, 
                                 rel_widths = c(1.115, .94, 
                                                .94, 1.15, .94)) +
                       theme(plot.margin = margin(2,2, 8.5,1,"mm"))

# Add plot note
resdomC.gg <- resdomC.gg + 
  draw_label(P1_line_1, x = .485, y = -0.02, size = 7.5) +
  draw_label(P1_line_2, x = .1625, y = -0.05, size = 7.5)

resdomC.gg
```
From the above plot we can see that the residuals are generally not well behaved. The health domain exhibits a near-perfect parabolic curve, while a less severe parabola can be seen in the crime domain. Even the education and living environment domains exhibit some semblance of non-uniformity, with systemic under-prediction occurring at the far end of both left and right tails.

### MFP 
I employ the Multivariable Fractional Polynomial procedure to determine the best-fitting functional form for each domain score. A generalization of polynomials, fractional polynomials provide a more flexible class of transformation functions. Although it is true that the inclusion of a simple square polynomial term would lead to a significant reduction in nonlinearity, I prefer the added power of MFP given the paramount importance of model fit in minimizing the influence of time-varying domains.

Fit MFP model with 4 degrees of freedom (FP2-max):
```{r, include=TRUE}
mfp2015 <- mfp(IMD ~ fp(educ) + fp(health) + fp(crime) + fp(barr) +
                     fp(livenv), family = gaussian, data = IMD_2015.df, verbose = FALSE)
```

Best fitting forms:
```{r, include=TRUE}
mfp2015$powers
```

Coefficients
```{r, include=TRUE}
mfp2015$coefficients
```

### OLS versus MFP
Matrix to store coefficients:
```{r, include = TRUE}
domreg.mat <- matrix(nrow = 16, ncol = 6,
                     dimnames = list(c(rep(c("Linear", "FP1", "FP2"),5) ,"$R^{2}$"),
                                     c(rep(c("(OLS)", "(MFP)"),3))))
```
 
Get coefficients:                                     
```{r, include = TRUE, results='hide'}
# Set increments
mcount <- 0
for (m in c("","mfp")) {
  mcount <- mcount + 1
  if (mcount == 1) {
    ycount <- 1
  }
  else {
    ycount <- 2
  }
  for (y in c(2010, 2015, 2019)) {
    print(y)
    pcount <- 1
    
    # OLS loop
    if (mcount == 1) {
      for (i in seq(from = 1, to = 13, by =3)) {
        print(i)
        pcount <- pcount + 1
        domreg.mat[i,ycount] <-  eval(parse(text=paste0("lm.",y,".bcoef[[1]][[pcount]]")))
      }
      domreg.mat[16,ycount] <- eval(parse(text=paste0("summary(lm.",y,")$r.squared")))
      ycount <- ycount + 2
    }
    
    # MFP loop
    else {
      for (i in c(2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15)) {
        
        pcount <- pcount + 1
        
        domreg.mat[i,ycount] <-  eval(parse(text=paste0("lm.mfp.",y,".bcoef[[1]][[pcount]]")))
      }
      
      domreg.mat[16,ycount] <- eval(parse(text=paste0("summary(lm.mfp.",y,")$r.squared")))
      ycount <- ycount + 2
    }
  }
}

Table 2 compares coefficients and model performance for OLS versus MFP regressions. Across all years, the MFP model provides a substantially better fit than OLS. For IMD 2015, the $R^{2}$ value jumps from 0.928 to 0.962, which amounts to a 50% reduction in the influence of the time-varying income and employment domains from 7.72% to 3.8%. This meets and exceeds the 5% benchmark set by Abel and colleagues. As expected, it is the transformation of the health and crime domains which is the major stimulus of this performance increase. Beta coefficients for these domains are drastically different for MFP as compared to OLS models; the $1^{st}$-degree FP turns negative (capturing the downwards slope on the left-hand side of the parabola), while the the $2^{nd}$-degree FP is positive (capturing the the right-hand side of the curve). Coefficients are highly consistent across years. This is significant because it implies that model residuals are correlated, and that the regression scaling will, *prima facie* , produce reliable results.


### The adjustment

2019 adjustment:
```{r,include = FALSE}
# MFP transformations
attach(IMD_2019.df)
IMD_2019.df$educ_FP1 <- educ/10
IMD_2019.df$educ_FP2 <- (educ/10) * log((educ/10))
IMD_2019.df$health_FP1 <- (health + 3.4)/10

IMD_2019.df$livenv_FP2 <- ((livenv / 10)^2) * log(livenv/10)
detach(IMD_2019.df)
# MFP regression
lm.mfp.2019 <- lm(IMD ~ educ_FP1 + educ_FP2 + health_FP1 + health_FP2 +
                    crime_FP1 + crime_FP2 + barr_FP1 + barr_FP2 + 
                    livenv_FP1 + livenv_FP2, data = IMD_2019.df)

# Residuals to data frame
IMD_2019.df$MFPres <- residuals(lm.mfp.2019)
# Store standard deviation of residuals

```
```{r, include = TRUE}
IMD_2019.df$IMD_tadj <-

  (coef_2015.mat[1] +

```
I then expand the 2010 and 2015 dataset to include observations for each year between 2010 and 2019:
```{r, include = TRUE}
# Expand function (mimics expand function in Stata)
expand <- function(df, ...) {
  as.data.frame(lapply(df, rep, ...))
}
# Expand up to (and including) 2018
IMD_2010_14.df <- expand(IMD_2010_2011B.df, times = 5)
IMD_2015.df$IMD_tadj <- IMD_2015.df$IMD
IMD_2015_18.df <- expand(IMD_2015.df, times = 4)
```
Combine the resulting datasets:
```{r, include = TRUE}
# Append
IMD_TS.df <- dplyr::bind_rows(IMD_2010_14.df, IMD_2015_18.df) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(LSOA_code) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(obno = row_number()) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()
# Map year values
IMD_TS.df$year = plyr::mapvalues(IMD_TS.df$obno, from = c(1:9),
                                 to = c(2010:2018))
IMD_TS.df$year <- as.numeric(as.character(IMD_TS.df$year))
```
And generate estimated IMD and time-adjusted IMD scores for missing years via linear interpolation:
```{r, include = TRUE}
# Set IMD score as missing for added years
IMD_TS.df <- IMD_TS.df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(IMD = case_when(year == 2010 | year == 2015 ~ as.numeric(IMD),
                                TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA))) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(IMD_tadj = case_when(year == 2010 | year == 2015 ~ as.numeric(IMD_tadj),
                                     TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA)))
# Add 2019 values 
IMD_TS.df <- dplyr::bind_rows(IMD_TS.df, IMD_2019.df) 
# Linear interpolation 
IMD_TS.df <- IMD_TS.df %>%
  dplyr::group_by(LSOA_code) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(IMD_ipol = na.approx(IMD, na.rm=FALSE)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(IMD_tadj_ipol = na.approx(IMD_tadj, na.rm=FALSE)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  # Decile rank of interpolated scores (by year)
  dplyr::group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(IMD_dec_ipol= ntile(IMD_ipol, 10)) %>%
  mutate(IMD_tadj_dec_ipol = ntile(IMD_tadj_ipol, 10)) %>%
  arrange(LSOA_code, year) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()
  head(select(IMD_TS.df, LSOA_code, year, IMD_ipol, IMD_tadj_ipol), 10)
```
